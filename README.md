[![GitHub Streak](https://streak-stats.demolab.com/?user=schwesig)](https://git.io/streak-stats)

👋 Hello! I'm Thor, a passionate software developer with over 35 years of coding experience. I embarked on my coding journey at the young age of 10, starting with Basic and gradually exploring various coding languages and frameworks over the years.

💼 Throughout my career, I have gained expertise in an array of technologies, including Basic, Pascal, Assembler, C, C++, C#, Python, JavaScript, Java, React, and more. This diverse skill set allows me to adapt to different projects and tackle complex challenges with ease.

🏆 Notable among my accomplishments is the successful implementation of a new tax and bonus system for a large company, ensuring compliance with evolving regulations. Additionally, I have led software implementations and change management processes for streamlining workflows, enabling fast adjustments to Corporate Identity in stores to align with marketing campaigns.

⚡ What truly drives me is my fascination with metrics and finding innovative ways to simplify and improve both work and life. I'm a firm believer in automation, following the mantra: "If you do something over and over again, you must automate it. If you haven't done something at least three times in the same way, do not overengineer."

🌱 As a software developer, I'm always eager to expand my knowledge and stay up to date with the latest industry trends. I value collaboration and thrive in team environments where I can contribute my expertise and learn from others. "Be a knowledge sharer"

🚀 Let's connect and collaborate on exciting projects that leverage technology to create efficient, high-quality solutions!
